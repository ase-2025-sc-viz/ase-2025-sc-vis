## Here are the steps to prepare the data 
Given cryptokitty transaction as the example
1. for the rpc call use "trace_transaction" as the method
2. get the colorful txt result of the trace using foundry tool
3. use the uploaded "substitute_types.py" to substitute the function call method with the actual function names
4. attach_money_flows.py is attaching the money flow result generate by money_flow_analyzer.py
5. to_trace_event.py is converting the result to the trace event format
6. to_trace_event_with_timestamps.py is inserting the timestamps




# ContractViz + Setup

## How to Launch the Software
You can either use the prebuilt executable or compile the software before running it.

To run Trace Compass on Linux, use the following command:

```bash
./tracecompass
```
### Notes:

* Ensure the file is executable. If not, you can make it executable with:

  ```bash
  chmod +x ./tracecompass
  ```

## Installing the Trace Event Parser Plugin

Once the application is running:

1. Go to the top menu.
2. Navigate to `Tools` > `Add-ons`.
3. Add the `Trace Event Parser` plugin from the list.

## Adding the Gas Usage View

To add the gas usage analysis view:

1. In the **Project Explorer**, right-click on `Traces`.
2. Select `Manage XML Analyses`.
3. In the window that appears, click the `Import` button.
4. Select the file `gas_cost_per_function.xml` located in the `addFiles` directory.

## Opening a Trace

1. Open the trace file named `???.json` from the `addFiles` directory.
2. Ensure that the corresponding `???_storage_report.json` file is also present in the `addFiles` directory. It is needed for the state changes.

These two files must be in the addFiles directory for the analysis to work properly.

# ContractViz + - Build and Run Instructions

You can also build ContractViz +.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* Java JDK 21
* Maven 3.9+
* Git
* A Linux system(x86\_64)
* GTK libraries required for SWT applications

## Build

To build the project without running unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DskipTests
```

This command:

* Cleans previous build files
* Compiles the project
* Skips tests to speed up the process

## Run

After a successful build, you can run Trace Compass using the following command:

```bash
./rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/target/products/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp/linux/gtk/x86_64/trace-compass/tracecompass
```

 ðŸ”§ Once Trace Compass is launched, make sure to enable the **Trace Event Parser** plugin by going to **Tools > Add-ons** and checking **Trace Event Parser**.

### Notes:

* Ensure the file is executable. If not, you can make it executable with:

  ```bash
  chmod +x ./rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/target/products/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp/linux/gtk/x86_64/trace-compass/tracecompass
  ```

* The path may vary slightly depending on the project version or Maven configuration.

## Troubleshooting

* If the build fails, check that all dependencies are properly resolved (common issues: `zest`, `jdt.annotation`, etc.).
* To force Maven to update dependencies:

  ```bash
  mvn clean install -U -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DskipTests
  ```
